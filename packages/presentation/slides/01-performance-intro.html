            Performance will be different between each of your projects, but what
            we do know is that

        <p>We can set up performance budgets</p>
        <p>We can run those Lighthouse audits as part of our build pipelines</p>
        <p>
          We can optimise, code split, lazy load, compress and minify our code
        </p>
        <p>
          We can monitor all of this using tools like Sentry or Google Search
          Console
        </p>
        <p>So we can get a very good idea when our websites are performant</p>

          Now, can we get into a situation where all of our performance
          measurements indicate that a site should be really ðŸ–± fast, but when we
          actually use the site, ðŸ–± it feels slow?

    <h2>Performant, but slow?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Statically built</li>
      <li class="fragment">Great for Lighthouse audits</li>
      <li class="fragment">... for cold visits</li>
      <li class="fragment">Not as relevant once app is loaded and being interacted with</li>
      <li class="fragment">What if ..
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">.. a slow connection</li>
          <li class="fragment">.. server doing alot</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="fragment">App will feel slow, <span class="fragment">despite Lighthouse</span></li>

    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        Well we could have a statically built site that accepts user
        interaction
      </p>
      <p>
        Being statically built will go a long way to acing the Lighthouse
        audit, but that's only for cold visits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a user has loaded their first web page, and starts to interact
        with the site, a lot of that performance work is less relevant
      </p>
      <p>
        In an SPA, after that first render, where a site feels fast or not is
        mostly dependent on the users network connection, and the load on the
        server
      </p>
      <p>If the connection is slow, API calls will take longer to resolve</p>
      <p>
        Similarly, if the server is under high stress, it will take longer to
        process those requests
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of these factors are going to give the user an impression of a
        slow website, regardless of how close we get Lighthouse to 100 for the
        performance metric
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we can control what we can control, like optimising our servers
        and adding caching layers, but the response time is never going to be
        instant
      </p>
      <p>However, we can make it feel instant</p>
