          Before we get into the patterns, I want to quickly explain the demo
          website that we're going to be enhancing throughout the presentation
        </li>
        <li
          >The recordings of the demo app were made with everything hosted on my
          machine ðŸ–±, including the server.</li
        >
        <li>
          The app is rendered using ReactðŸ–± , however all the enhancements we're
          going to make are done using ðŸ–± vanilla JS
        </li>
        <li>
          The reason for this is because the actual code implementation of the
          patterns isn't the important part of the talk, so I wanted to show
          that it's not reliant on any frameworks
        </li>
        <li>
          As all code was on my machine, that meant that network requests would
          be instant, so I added a slight ðŸ–± delay into the server code to
          replicate a delay that would be felt if we were actually hitting the
          Internet and waiting for a response
        </li>
        <li>
          Using frameworks might make some of this raw code simpler, but I'll
          leave that up to you to play around with in your specific stacks
        </li>
        <li
          >ðŸ–± I'm going to show you all the starting point of the app in a
          second</li
        >
        <li
          >But first, I wanted to make this presentation as interactive as
          possible, by not only showing the patterns up on screen here, but also
          letting you experience them first hand, so the demo app that we're
          working with up on screen, is available to you right now ðŸ–±</li

        <li>
          For people watching on the video, the URL is going to be
          perceivedperformance.lukedenton.dev, but for everyone here and now,
          you can just use wdc.lukedenton.dev
        </li>
        <li
          >As we work through the presentation, the app on your device will
          automatically tell you when the next demo is available, so you can
          stay in sync with what I'm showing up on the screen</li
