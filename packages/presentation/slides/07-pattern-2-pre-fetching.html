          The goal of this pattern is to üñ± prevent the user from having to wait
          üñ± at all, giving the user the experience of visiting the product page
          the second time, but without having yet visited it
        </li>
        <li>
          Pre-fetching is simply downloading resources before the user has asked
          for them, so that when they are asked for, they're already downloaded
          and can be instantly shown to the user
        </li>
        <li>What kinds of things could we pre-fetch?</li>
        <li>
          üñ± Literally anything can be pre-fetched,üñ± however we do want to
          consider our users experience and situation before going ahead and
          pre-fetching everything
        </li>
        <li>
          üñ± For example, optimistically pre-fetching data is perfectly fine.
          That data will be compressed on the server and then sent to the
          browser to be uncompressed and rendered
        </li>
        <li>
          That data could include a second page of products, or a specific
          products' data
        </li>
        <li>
          Pre-fetching JS/CSS files could also be a good option, especially if
          we've made use of code splitting, and we can anticipate the next route
          that a user is going to go to
        </li>
        <li>
          üñ± Pre-fetching images and other media, however, carries a lot more
          weight in terms of bandwidth, so it would usually be a bad idea to
          pre-fetch, especially if we're not sure if the user is going to see it
        </li>
        <li>
          If we know that the user absolutely has to see the image or media in
          order to continue, then go right ahead and pre-fetch, but otherwise
          it's not a good idea to optimistically pre-fetch images or other media
        </li>
        <li>
          Knowing what to pre fetch is only part of the pattern, üñ± when to
          pre-fetch is just as important

        <li>üñ± Are there any downsides to pre-fetching?</li>
        <li>
          üñ± Pre-fetching is using more of the users download bandwith, however
          if we're sticking only to downloading data, and that data is
          compressed on the server before being passed to the browser, then that
          bandwidth increase will usually be negligible
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider keeping track of what has been pre-fetched, so you're not
          pre-fetching the same thing twice
        </li>
        <li
          >üñ± As mentioned earlier, there are storage limitations within the

        <li>üñ± A user is on a slow connection</li>
        <li>
          In this instance, we might want to alter our pre-fetching strategy
          depending on the users connection.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, if they have a good connection, then we might be a little
          more optimistic in pre-fetching, but if they have a poor connection,
          then we might be a little more conservative üñ±

        saveData, which tells the browser if the user has explicitly said that

        disable any pre-fetching.

      <li>Will these extra requests üñ± strain the server?</li>
      <li>They certainly could, especially at scale</li>
      <li>
        However, at scale, there will almost certainly be a server caching layer
        implemented. For example, Cloudflare
      </li>
      <li>
        The server caching layer acts to resolve all the requests that it has
        seen before, so multiple users being on a category page, that is
        automatically pre-fetching the next page of products, will onlly hit the
        app server once, with the cache layer serving the response for all other
        users
      </li>
      <li>
        Out of scope of this talk, but just quickly, the reason the data in this
        caching layer doesn't go stale is because it can be selectively cleared,
        for example, when prices have been updated, product relative information
        in the caching layer can be programmatically purged, so the next request
        will hit the server
