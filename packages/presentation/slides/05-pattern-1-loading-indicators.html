          More specifically, ðŸ–± not using loading indicators, ðŸ–± well using them
          sparingly
        </li>
        <li>
          Conventional wisdom would say that loading indicators are required,
          and they are, but the overuse of them will lead to a perception of a
          slow website
        </li>
        <li>Let's do a comparison</li>

    <h2>Loading Indicators</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">We used loading indicators</li>
      <li class="fragment">Competitor waited for request to resolve</li>
      <li class="fragment">Our requests weren't slower</li>

    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      <ul>
        <li>This is exactly the situation we had with one of our clients</li>
        <li>
          They were comparing their website (that we built) with a competitors
          website, and saying that the competitors was faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          ðŸ–± We were using a loading indicator as a result of all interactions
          where a user does have to wait
        </li>
        <li>ðŸ–± The competitors website wasn't</li>
        <li>
          ðŸ–± Even though, looking at the raw numbers, the rquests in the website
          we built were resolving just as fast, and sometimes faster, the client
          ðŸ–± felt that their site was slower, because they could see exatly when
          they were being made to wait
        </li>
        <li>
          The issue that we had with the competitors implementation, and the
          reason we didn't want to go the same route, is that when a user
          clicks, nothing actually happens until the network request resolves.
        </li>
        <li>
          As I recorded everything locally, we're only waiting for the forced
          server delay, but what if I was on a slower connection, ðŸ–± where the
          request did take a few more moments to respond?
        </li>
        <li>Or what if the user was on lie-fi?</li>
        <li>They would ðŸ–± click a link, and then see that nothing happens </li>
        <li>
          They would likely ðŸ–±click the link again, and ðŸ–±again. Creating multiple
          requests for the same thing, using up bandwidth, and almost certainly
          registering a ðŸ–± rage click event in your analytics

        <li>
          So that's what I mean when I say that the overuse of loading
          indicators can give the perception of poor performance, ðŸ–± because
          users know exactly when they're being made to wait
        </li>
        <li>
          ðŸ–± Could we combine both approaches and have the best of both worlds? ðŸ–±

          >For this next demonstration, I made use of DevTools to throttle my
          network connection. Neither the client nor server code has been
          changed</li
        >
        <li>
          As we can see, the click event is registered, nothing happens, then
          after a short amount of time, a loading indicator is shown
        </li>
        <li>
          For users that have a fast connection, they won't see a loading
          indicator
        </li>
        <li>
          For users on a slow connection, they will see the loading indicator
          after 1s, so they'll know that the website has received their input,
          and is currently processing it
        </li>
        <li>
          The 1s timeout is an arbitrary value, it's really up to your situation
          what value you choose
