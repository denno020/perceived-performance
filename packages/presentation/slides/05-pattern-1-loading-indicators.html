          More specifically, 🖱 not using loading indicators, 🖱 well using them
          sparingly
        </li>
        <li>
          Conventional wisdom would say that loading indicators are required,
          and they are, but the overuse of them will lead to a perception of a
          slow website
        </li>
        <li>Let's do a comparison</li>
      </ul>

    <div
      >🏗️ Create animation displaying the transition from category page to
      product page again, with the footer pushed below the fold. Likely could
      re-use the same animation used to demonstrate the footer being pushed

          📺 First, let's look again at our demo website and focus on one
          specific transition
        </li>
        <li>
          📺 When I click on a product on the category page, I'm are taken to
          the next view immediately, with a loading indicator being displayed to
          show that data is being loaded
        </li>
        <li>
          📺 Feels pretty fast, even with the added server delay, no reason to
          think that it would be perceived as slow
        </li>
        <li>📺 Users know exactly what is happening at all times</li>

    <div
      >🏗️ Create an animation display the transition from category page to
      product page, when fetch first is enabled<br />
      This is also where demo 3 needs to be enabled, not in the next slide
    </div>
    <aside class="notes">
      <ul>
        <li>📺 Now, let's have a look at this next example (Demo 3)🖱s</li>
        <li>
          📺 We have the same code, but we're not displaying a loading indicator
        </li>
        <li>
          📺 In this demo, I click on a product and then the very next thing
          that I see, is that product
        </li>
        <li>📺 Did I have to wait?</li>
        <li>Did I perceive that I had to wait?</li>
        <li>📺 Which one feels faster?</li>
        <li>📺 This is exactly the situation we had with one of our clients</li>
        <li>
          📺 They were comparing their website (that we built) with a
          competitors website, and saying that the competitors was faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          📺 We were using a loading indicator as a result of all interactions
          where a user does have to wait
        </li>
        <li>📺 The competitors website wasn't</li>
        <li>
          📺 Even though, looking at the raw numbers, the rquests in the website
          we built were resolving just as fast, and sometimes faster, the client
          felt that their site was slower, because they could see exatly when
          they were being made to wait
        </li>
        <li>
          📺 The issue that we had with the competitors implementation, and the
          reason we didn't want to go the same route, is that when a user
          clicks, nothing actually happens until the network request resolves.
        </li>
        <li>
          📺 As I recorded everything locally, we're only waiting for the forced
          server delay, but what if I was on a slower connection, where the
          request did take a few more moments to respond?
        </li>
        <li>📺 Or what if the user was on lie-fi?</li>
        <li> 📺 They would click a link, and then see that nothing happens </li>
        <li>
          📺 They would likely click the link again, and again. Creating
          multiple requests for the same thing, using up bandwidth, and almost
          certainly registering a rage click event in your analytics<br />
          (🏗️ Do I want to create an animation of someone clicking again and
          again, and then an angry face emoji fading in...)

    <h2>Loading Indicators</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not using loading indicators</li>
      <li>Well using them sparingly <sup>Demo 2</sup></li>
      <li class="fragment">Show's exactly when a user is being made to wait</li>

    <aside class="notes">
      <ul>
        <li>
          So that's what I mean when I say that the overuse of loading
          indicators can give the perception of poor performance, 🖱 because
          users know exactly when they're being made to wait
        </li>
        <li>
          🖱 Could we combine both approaches and have the best of both worlds? 🖱
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div
      >🏗️ Generate an animation showing the transition from the category page to
      the product page, with fetch first enabled, and on a throttled network
      connection</div

    <aside class="notes">
      <ul>
        <li
          >📺 For this next demonstration, I made use of DevTools to throttle my
          network connection. Neither the client nor server code has been
          changed</li
        >
        <li>
          📺 In this combined example, we don't display a loading indicator
          until after the user has been waiting for a period of time
        </li>
        <li>
          📺 For users that have a fast connection, they won't see a loading
          indicator
        </li>
        <li>
          📺 For users on a slow connection, they will see the loading indicator
          after 1s, so they'll know that the website has received their input,
          and is currently processing it
        </li>
        <li>
          📺 The 1s timeout is an arbitrary value, it's really up to your
          situation what value you choose
