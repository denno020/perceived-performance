          Optimistically being the operative word - ðŸ–± assume everything is going
          to go perfectly according to plan on the server
        </li>
        <li>
          If we assume that, then in the example of adding an item to cart, we
          can ðŸ–± manually edit our local state to make it look like the item is
          already added

          ðŸ“º Looking back at the demo website, we can see that upon clicking on
          the Add to Cart button, the user has to wait for that API request to
          complete, before they can be sure that the item is added to cart, and
          then continue on with their shopping
        </li>
        <li>Why make the user wait for that confirmation?</li>
        <li>Let's go ahead and speed that interaction up</li>

          ðŸ–± We should talk about the potential pitfalls to optimistically
          updating the UI
        </li>
        <li
          >The most obvious one being, what happens if the action fails? ðŸ–±
        </li>
        <li>
          What happens if, in this example, the item isn't added to cart on the
          server?
        </li>
        <li>
          This is entirely possible - maybe there isn't any stock available for
          that product, maybe there weren't enough options selected, or maybe
          there was just some sort of internal server error
        </li>
        <li>
          In all of these instances, we'll need to provide a notice to the user
          that the item hasn't been successfully added to cart, and update the
          UI to remove our optimistically added product
        </li>
        <li>
          For the most part, I would expect these situations to be the exception
          rather than the rule, but if there is the possibility that it might
          happen to one user, then it's best to build a way to handle it
        </li>
