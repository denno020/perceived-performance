      <li>Before I go too much further, I would like to introduce myself</li>
      <li>ðŸ–±My name is Luke Denton</li>
      <li>ðŸ–±I'm the Principal Frontend Software Engineer at ðŸ–±Aligent</li>
      <li
        >And this is my first talk at a big conference, so the buutterflies are
        going crazy right now</li

        At Aligent, we build ecommerce websites for clients with customers both
        nationally and internationally
      </li>
      <li>
        Performance at scale is something that is very important to us and our
        clients
      </li>
      <li>
        Our sites regularly have tens of thousands of concurrent users, not only
        consuming data, but also writing by adding items to cart (think click
        frenzy and cyber monday), which really tests the infrastructure and
        performance of those sites
      </li>
      <li>
        Today I'm going to be sharing some ðŸ–± patterns that we have been
        exploring for use in our ecommerce PWA's to ensure a user always gets
        the best experience possible
