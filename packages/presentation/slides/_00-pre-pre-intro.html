        Written for and presented at Web Directions '23
        <ul>
          <li>Using ecommerce as a base for examples</li>
          <li
            >This is by no means a limiting factor on the concepts I'm talking
            about though</li
          >
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li
        >They equally apply to web apps like NCP, which I'll call out as we go
        along</li
      >
      <li
        >As well as explaining why ecommerce, I also wanted to give that context
        because</li
      >
      <li
        >The first real slide of the presentation works best when we're all in
        the room</li
      >
      <li>However, we'll persevere</li>
      <li>On the next slide, I'm going to ask for a show of hands</li>
      <li
        >To make it a little more interesting, when you throw your hand up, give
        me a shakas, or rock on, or give him out, just don't use the other one
        finger solute</li
