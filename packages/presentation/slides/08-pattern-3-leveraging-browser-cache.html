          We've enhanced our app to make loading a product page nearly feel
          instantaneous
        </li>
        <li>🖱 The image is clearly coming in late though</li>
        <li>
          📺 We've decided against pre-fetching images, because we don't want to
          potentially waste our users bandwidth, 🖱 so how can we make the image
          feel instant?
        </li>
        <li>Well that's where we can lean on the browser cache</li>
        <li>
          The browser has already seen an image for this product, on the
          category page
        </li>
        <li>
          Why don't we just 🖱 re-use that exact image as a placeholder for the
          product page, while the main, high resolution image is being
          downloaded?
        </li>
        <li>
          This technique is incredibly simple, all we have to do is request the
          🖱 same image path that we requested when on the category page, and the
          browser will automatically use the image that is stored in cache
        </li>
        <li>🖱 Demo (6)</li>

        <li>
          There's only two that I can think of, 🖱 depending on the resolution of
          image that is required on the product page, the cached image that is
          displayed as a placeholder could appear exceptionally pixelated
        </li>
        <li>
          I don't think this is that big of a deal though, as it would just
          appear like a progressively loaded JPG, with the benefit of holding
          the vertical space for the high resolution image to come in
        </li>
        <li>
          Another potential issue is if the main image used on your product page
          is 🖱 different to the image used on the category page
        </li>
        <li>
          Where in your control, I would advise against doing this, though, as
          it could confuse users
        </li>
